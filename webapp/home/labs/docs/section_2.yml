      A workflow is a series of Galaxy tools that have been linked together
      to perform a specific analysis. You can use and customize the example workflows
      below.

          <p>
            Yes. Galaxy Australia has assembly tools for small prokaryote genomes as well as larger eukaryote genomes.
            We are continually adding new tools and optimising them for large genome assemblies
            - this means adding enough computer processing power to run data-intensive tools, as well as configuring
            aspects such as parallelisation
          </p>

            <li>See the tutorials in this Help section. They cover different approaches to genome assembly</li>
            <li>Read the methods in scientific papers about genome assembly, particularly those about genomes with similar characteristics to those in your project</li>
            <li>See the Workflows section for examples of different approaches to genome assembly - these cover different sequencing data types, and a variety of tools.</li>
